```This code introduces the use of the NLTK library's sentiment intensity analyzer, VADER, to provide sentiment analysis of user feedback. This sentiment score is stored alongside the feedback itself in the CSV file. We also added error handling for invalid feedback type inputs, ensuring the program ends gracefully in such scenarios.
