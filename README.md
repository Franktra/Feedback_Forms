# Feedback_Forms
Feedback Forms
### In this script, we're using the getpass function from the getpass module to hide the user's input when they're typing their feedback. This is to avoid any potential issues with displaying potentially sensitive feedback on the screen. 
If this isn't a concern for you, you can replace getpass with the standard input function.
The feedback script is well-structured and functional, but enhancements are needed: User Input Validation: Currently, there is no validation for the user input. Error Handling: The script lacks robust error handling, we can add some checks to handle common exceptions that could possibly occur during the execution of the script.Sentiment Analysis Optimization: The sentiment analysis is currently being performed only on the feedback text. 

After each descriptive feedback answer, we're running sentiment analysis using Hugging Face's sentiment analysis pipeline, and then saving the sentiment alongside the feedback in the answers list. Then, when we write the feedback data to the CSV file, each row will consist of the rating, the descriptive feedback, and the sentiment of the feedback.
 ### UPDATES
Instead of just asking users to rate an instructor's performance on a scale of 1-5, we can also ask them to provide a few sentences explaining their rating. The sentiment of these sentences can then be analyzed using a sentiment analysis library or service. We can then correlate these sentiments with the numerical ratings.
#  Feedback_form_tutorials

The provided updated version of the script incorporates the insights to improve the script feedback form. In this updated version, each tutorial now includes a feedback_form section that specifies the questions to be included in the feedback form and whether contact information should be collected. The script also references the feedback form link in the printout of tutorial content and the text file.

**Replace the placeholder link values in the feedback_form sections with the actual feedback form links**


# Optimized version of the script that enhances functionality and ease of use for the feedback form
In this optimized version, the feedback form questions are stored as dictionaries, which include the question text and the corresponding field name for the answer. This allows for easier management and flexibility when adding or modifying questions in the form.

The answers are stored in a dictionary (answers) instead of a list to improve readability and make it easier to associate the answers with their respective fields. The sentiment analysis results are also stored with the corresponding feedback fields.

The save_feedback_data function now uses csv.DictWriter to write the feedback data to a CSV file, allowing for better organization and readability of the data.

Overall, these optimizations enhance the functionality and ease of use of the script by providing a more structured approach to the feedback form and improving the organization of the feedback data.

# generate_feedback_email_form; Generate the email body; Generate sending the email  
 For sending feedback requests via email.

This code defines a function generate_feedback_form that takes the user's name, email, and feedback as input. It generates the email body, saves it to a file named {name}_feedback.txt, and generates the code for sending the email. The email code uses the smtplib library to send the email using an SMTP server.

To use this code in an email, replace 'your_smtp_server', 'your_username', 'your_password', and 'your_email@example.com' with the actual SMTP server details and email address. After making the necessary changes, include the generated email code in the email template and send it to the user.

Please note that you need to have a working SMTP server and valid credentials to send emails using this code.

# Feedback_form_tutorials CHANGED TO Feedback_Form_Materials, a revised version of the script incorporating these improvements: 
Please note: **to reflect changes in the feedback form.** Update questions and fieldnames in the function save_feedback_data(data) 
The feedback script is well-structured and functional, strengthened with enhancements/improvements:

Integrating Action Framework: The Action Framework is helpful in gathering more targeted feedback by prompting users to consider specific elements while they're giving feedback. This could help in driving more meaningful improvements in the chatbot's performance.

User Input Validation: Checks added to ensure that the rating provided by the user is within the acceptable range (1-5).

Error Handling: The script's robust error handling added; now handles common exceptions that could possibly occur during the execution of the script.

Sentiment Analysis Optimization: The sentiment analysis extended to all fields for more comprehensive insights.

# tutorial dictionary
### ** Please note**: This script assumes that tutorials dictionary is in the same Python file. Also, you'll need to ensure that the first time you run save_feedback_data, it includes a header row. You could check if the file is empty, and if it is, write data.keys() as the first row.
The tutorial dictionary contains valuable resources but needed: add sentiment analysis, link for the feedback form, and contact_info field in use, provide an interactive experience for the users.
