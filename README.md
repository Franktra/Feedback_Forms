Feedback Forms
### In this script, we're using the getpass function from the getpass module to hide the user's input when they're typing their feedback. This is to avoid any potential issues with displaying potentially sensitive feedback on the screen. 
If this isn't a concern for you, you can replace getpass with the standard input function.

After each descriptive feedback answer, we're running sentiment analysis using Hugging Face's sentiment analysis pipeline, and then saving the sentiment alongside the feedback in the answers list. Then, when we write the feedback data to the CSV file, each row will consist of the rating, the descriptive feedback, and the sentiment of the feedback.
 ### UPDATES
Instead of just asking users to rate an instructor's performance on a scale of 1-5, we can also ask them to provide a few sentences explaining their rating. The sentiment of these sentences can then be analyzed using a sentiment analysis library or service. We can then correlate these sentiments with the numerical ratings.
#  Feedback_form_tutorials

The provided updated version of the script incorporates the insights to improve the script feedback form. In this updated version, each tutorial now includes a feedback_form section that specifies the questions to be included in the feedback form and whether contact information should be collected. The script also references the feedback form link in the printout of tutorial content and the text file.

**Replace the placeholder link values in the feedback_form sections with the actual feedback form links**
